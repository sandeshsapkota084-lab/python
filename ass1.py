print(my_parrot.describe())

#3. Create a Account class with a display() method. Create a SavingsAccount that extends display() using super() to also show the interest rate.
class Account:
    def __init__(self, account_number):
        self.account_number = account_number
    def display(self):
        return f"Account Number: {self.account_number}"

class SavingsAccount(Account):
    def __init__(self, account_number, interest_rate):
        super().__init__(account_number)
        self.interest_rate = interest_rate

        return "Car is charging"
    
my_electric_car = ElectricCar()
print(my_electric_car.start_engine())
print(my_electric_car.drive())
print(my_electric_car.charge())

#2. Create hierarchical inheritance: Shape as parent, with Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle as children. Each child has its own area() method.
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        return "Area not defined for generic shape"
    
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    def area(self):
        import math
        return math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
class Triangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, base, height):
        self.base = base
        self.height = height
    def area(self):
        return 0.5 * self.base * self.height
    
circle = Circle(5)
rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)
triangle = Triangle(4, 5)
print(f"Circle Area: {circle.area()}")
print(f"Rectangle Area: {rectangle.area()}")
print(f"Triangle Area: {triangle.area()}")

#3. Identify which type of inheritance would be best for: (a) a school system with Teacher and Student, (b) a file system with File to TextFile to EncryptedTextFile, (c) a game with Character having Warrior, Mage, and Archer children.
# (a) For a school system with Teacher and Student, hierarchical inheritance would be best, with a common parent class (e.g., Person) that both Teacher and Student inherit from.
# (b) For a file system with File to TextFile to EncryptedTextFile,
#multilevel inheritance would be best, where File is the parent class, TextFile inherits from File, and EncryptedTextFile inherits from TextFile.
# (c) For a game with Character having Warrior, Mage, and Archer children, hierarchical inheritance would be best, with Character as the parent class and Warrior, Mage, and Archer as child classes that inherit from Character.
